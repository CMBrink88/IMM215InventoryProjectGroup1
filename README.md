IMM215 Group1 Inventory Project

Chris's Contributions-*Began project, wrote Parent/Child basic script for Keys and created key sprites*
 
Owen's Contributions- *Added UI elements and created trigger script for end of maze*
 
Micheal's Contributions- *Revised Key scripts, added door scripts and sprites*

Goal of script: Have the player move along the maze and collect 3 different colored keys to open the different colored doors to reach the end. 

Collaboration Notes: Due to issues with other classes, it was a bit of a challenge to try and coordinate and divide contributions. We had issues in the begining with our Git and Unity project not syncing up with eachother and required a restart on the project in order to fix our issues. Afterwords though we kept in contact through Discord and assigned roles, Each time when one person's contribution was finished we noted to push the project. Overall, I believe we all worked well for the limited time we had to work on our projects.
